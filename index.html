                Short stories teach kids lessons in a way that makes them more
                relatable and interesting. Rather than telling them not to lie,
                tell
                them a short story in English about what happens if they lie; it
                helps them become more conscious of their actions and the
                results of
                those actions. These stories' moral lessons also help influence
                their character and moral conscience as they grow older.

                Reading these small stories is the right way to teach them life
                lessons in a way that they will understand. Every parent must
                encourage kids to read simple short story in English as it is
                one of
                the most accessible forms of education. Read the entire article
                to
